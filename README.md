# Description

Toy project that shows the weather forecast for 5 days, given a Brazilian city name.

It uses an API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to return the forecast, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) as a web server for [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) module for Python.

# Usage:
Install [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/) and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install), set your FLASK_APP environment variable as `main.py` and execute the command `flask run`. Then just open a browser in the address given by Flask.
